## UPDATE

10/28/2023. First time i upload this project, no UI for now, game 100% playable on console and winnable.

10/28/2023. #2 Update not the code but the files on it into multiples files so the code its easier to read.

10/28/2023. #3 Changed the name of some cards so they have a little description or info of what they do.

## How to play

1. Use/Download JDK 17, this is needed due that i'm using gradle and will load everytime we start the main.java file, also its due that Gradle doesn't work that well with versions older than JDK19 (at the moment i'm uploading this will be JDK 20 and JDK 21)

2. By just downloading the code as source should be enough, open /src/main.java and run the main class or even FourSoulsGame class, both should start the code/game from the start leading you to see the rules and select how many players will be playing
